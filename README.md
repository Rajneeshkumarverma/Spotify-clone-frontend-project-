## Project Overview

This project is a frontend implementation of a simplified version of the Spotify music streaming platform, exclusively using HTML and CSS. While it doesn't have all the features of the real Spotify, it demonstrates my skills in creating responsive and visually appealing web interfaces.

Key features include:
- Displaying a list of songs and artists.
- Stylish user interface with HTML and CSS only.
- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
